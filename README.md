# 🧙 Game Master Agent (Fantasy Adventure)

An interactive, text-based fantasy adventure game powered by multi-agent logic.

### 🧠 What It Does

- **NarratorAgent**: Drives the story and narrative
- **MonsterAgent**: Handles combat using tools like `roll_dice()` and `generate_event()`
- **ItemAgent**: Manages inventory and rewards

### ⚙️ How It Works

- `game_master_agent` interprets user actions and routes them to the correct agent.
- Tools simulate randomness and combat.
- Each part of the story is handled by its own agent.

Built using **OpenAI Agent SDK + Runner** with **Chainlit UI**.
